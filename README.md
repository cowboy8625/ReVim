# Project Has been Archived

I have been working on ReVim for as long as I have been using Rust, so about 2 years. Making a simple text editor is not super difficult
but making one that is usable for everyday use and mostly one that supports all the features I want for ReVim is a lot more then knew upon
making ReVim.   I wanted it to have:
 - **Plugin Support** for remapping keys or just making more feature for ReVim 
 - **LSP Support** for the language servers
 - **Package Manager** Unlike Vim or NeoVim I would have like to a built in package manager just to say I have made one.
 - **WebSite** If there is a **Package Manager** then it would need a **WebSite** to just go look for and upload user made plugins.
I am not giving up mind you, I am only letting you know I move the project to a new repo.
### [ReVi](https://github.com/cowboy8625/revi)

#### Why?

This project was a learning project but ReVi is going to be my main editor once it is in a usable state.
ReVim was never going to be that kind of editor and was more of a Vim Clone rather then a Vim inspired Editor 
and its nice to have a clean start.

# ReVim

ReVim stands for "Rust Edition Vim".  I wanted a Simple Vim that would compile
and run on any terminal. We all know Vim can be ran on windows
but its not the easiest to do although NeoVim makes this pretty simple I have found.
Never the less I just really wanted to make a text editor,
so this was a cool project to do. Currently ReVim is in a very early stage of
progress.  If you would like to contribute to ReVim submit a pull request.

# Update

I have restarted this project so many times do to bad structuring of the code.
It's not hard to make a text editor but I am very picky and really wanted something easy to
add features to later down the road.
