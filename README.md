# ReVim

ReVim stands for "Rust Edition Vim".  I wanted a Simple vim that would compile and run on any terminal
like in windows. We all know Vim can be ran on windows but its not the easiest to do.
ALSO I just really wanted to make a text editor, so this was a cool project to do.
Currently ReVim is in a very early statge of progress.  If you would like to contribute
to ReVim submite a pull request.
