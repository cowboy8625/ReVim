# ReVim

ReVim stands for "Rust Edition Vim".  I wanted a Simple Vim that would compile
and run on any terminal. We all know Vim can be ran on windows
but its not the easiest to do although NeoVim makes this pretty simple I have found.
Never the less I just really wanted to make a text editor,
so this was a cool project to do. Currently ReVim is in a very early stage of
progress.  If you would like to contribute to ReVim submit a pull request.

# Update

I have restarted this project so many times do to bad structuring of the code.
It's not hard to make a text editor but I am very picky and really wanted something easy to
add features to later down the road.
