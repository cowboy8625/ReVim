ReVim stands for "Rust Edition Vim".  I wanted a Simple vim that would compile
and run on any terminal like in windows. We all know Vim can be ran on windows
but its not the easiest to do. ALSO I just really wanted to make a text editor,
so this was a cool project to do. Currently ReVim is in a very early statge of
progress.  If you would like to contribute to ReVim submite a pull request.
